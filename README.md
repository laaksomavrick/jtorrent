This package is in its early stages of development, and thus, I have nothing particularly useful to say about it (other than to avoid reading the code for the moment :-)).

I also make no commitment to ever finishing this repo - developing it serves primarily to familiarize myself with java, and learn a little about how p2p protocols work.
